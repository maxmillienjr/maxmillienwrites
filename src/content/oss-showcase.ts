Yarn Berry workspaces, NestJS API, React 19 client, and a TypeScript AI engine package wired with LangGraph and Vertex AI. Demonstrates the Stateless Specialist Pattern: agents are pure functions over typed state, the orchestration graph is the only stateful surface, and every node is independently testable in isolation.",
