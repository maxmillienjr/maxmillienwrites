    bio: [
      'I am an engineer by trade and a writer by survival. I had to reverse-engineer my own mind. I had to debug the crash.',
      'I wrote Traffic Engineer to prove that a human life, no matter how corrupted, can be restored if you have the right data. But a notebook is just a snapshot. It is static.',
      'Real legacy requires a system. I built PureTome because the process of writing my story has had such a profound and positive effect on my trajectory and focus that it was worth sharing. I engineered this AI Biographer platform to turn that same clarity into forward momentum for anyone looking to start or finish their book.',

    summary: [
      'For Max Millien, reality was just another system to optimize. A restless mind. A gnawing hunger for control and escape. When he found chemical oblivion, he treated it like a project to perfect.',
      'What began as self-medication scaled into a total structural collapse, engineered with ruthless precision. But logic cannot patch betrayal, and no architecture survives human chaos.',
      'Traffic Engineer is a harrowing memoir of freefall, a six-year exile, and the methodical work of resurrection. It is the record of a man who thought he could hack his way through the dark, only to discover the most complex system he would ever rebuild from zero was himself.',
